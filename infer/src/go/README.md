Beginning of Go frontend

Our starting point is an OCaml parser and AST for a subset of Go, which was developed as part of the
McGill COMP520 course requirements by Rohan Jacob-Rao, Steven Thephsourinthone and Shawn Otis.
This included a type checker, weeders and generation of C code, though we will only use the frontend
to hook up with Infer.
